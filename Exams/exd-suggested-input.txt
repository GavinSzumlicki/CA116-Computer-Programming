#Given a program and had to deduce what it was doing
1. p = t-e-ro-es--re-re-
   w = the roses are red
   
2. If both the lengths are the same, then the program
   checks for equality between p and w. If there is
   a hyphen in p at position i then there doesn't have
   to be a matching character in w at position i.
   then the program prints yes or no depending on whether
   or not both the inputs are matching with the exception
   of character positions where there are hyphens.
